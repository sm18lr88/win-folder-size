# Technical Overview

## How It Works

FolderSize is a COM shell extension DLL registered with `regsvr32`. It installs six hooks into Explorer via [Microsoft Detours](https://github.com/microsoft/detours):

| Hook | Target | Purpose |
|------|--------|---------|
| `CFSFolder::_GetSize` | `windows.storage.dll` | Intercepts folder size queries; returns size from Everything |
| `CRecursiveFolderOperation::Prepare/Do` | `windows.storage.dll` | RAII guard: suppresses size injection during copy/move/delete |
| `PSFormatForDisplayAlloc` | `propsys.dll` | Human-readable formatting (B/KB/MB/GB/TB) instead of "1,572,864 KB" |
| `PSFormatForDisplay` | `propsys.dll` | Same, for older Open/Save dialogs |
| `RegQueryValueExW` | `kernelbase.dll` | Injects `System.Size` into Explorer's property format strings so sizes appear in Tiles, Content, Details-pane, and status-bar views |

A background thread (`SHChangeNotifyRegister`) watches for filesystem changes and invalidates stale cache entries — including all ancestor directories — so sizes stay current after file operations.

Folder sizes come from [Everything](https://www.voidtools.com/) via named pipe IPC (pre-indexed, sub-millisecond per query). For non-NTFS drives, a fallback recursive scanner runs with a 200 ms timeout. If Everything isn't running, folders show blank — same as stock Explorer.

For a full breakdown of each hook target, symbol resolution strategy, and reversibility guarantees, see [`hook-targets.md`](hook-targets.md).

## Performance

Microsoft's official position is that folder sizes in Explorer would hurt performance — which was true when they last evaluated it, because the only viable approach at the time was a recursive directory scan: blocking, O(files), disk I/O on the UI thread.

Everything changes that. Sizes come from a pre-built in-memory index via named pipe IPC. Measured on a real session browsing `node_modules` directories with hundreds of packages:

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| Average IPC round-trip | 0.6 ms |
| Worst case | 4 ms |
| Sub-millisecond queries | 77% |
| Queries measured | 78 |
| Peak throughput | ~600 queries/sec |
| UI thread blocked | Never (worker thread) |

The LRU cache (50 MB, 5-min TTL) means repeat visits to the same folder are instant — no IPC at all. Cache entries are invalidated immediately when files change, so sizes never go stale.

Microsoft's concern is legitimate for a naive implementation. This isn't one.
